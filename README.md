## 📄 What is gml2step?

gml2step is a simple toolkit that helps you convert 3D city model files (CityGML format) into STEP files used in CAD applications. It comes from the Paper-CAD project and is designed to make working with 3D city data easier and more accessible. If you want to work with city maps and turn them into precise 3D designs, this tool can help.

This toolkit works with files related to building information modeling (BIM), geospatial data, and CAD software. It supports popular data types used in urban planning and engineering, allowing you to convert detailed city models into formats used by many design programs.

## 🔧 How to Use gml2step

1. **Open the program** on your computer.
2. **Load a CityGML file**:
   - Click the "Open File" button.
   - Select your `.gml` or `.xml` CityGML file from your system.
3. **Choose the output format**:
   - Default output is STEP, but options might be available.
4. **Start the conversion**:
   - Click the "Convert" button.
   - Wait while gml2step processes the file. Processing time depends on the model size.
5. **Save the STEP file**:
   - After conversion, save the output file to your desired folder.
6. **Open the STEP file** in your preferred CAD software for viewing or further editing.

## 🛠 Troubleshooting Tips

- If the program does not start, check that your operating system and hardware meet the requirements.
- For missing Python errors, ensure Python 3.7+ is installed and added to your system path.
- Large files may take a few minutes. If the program stops responding for a while, wait longer before cancelling.
- Ensure you download the right version for your OS.
- If files don’t convert correctly, verify that the CityGML file is valid and complete.
